This is an implementation of an AI for the competitive programming game Robocode. I chose to include it despite it being in C# because it shows my implementation of an important AI type for games programming, a finite state machine. I am very happy with the modularity and quality of the architecture of my FSM implementation.

This C# script can't compile and run on it's own, as it needs the greater Robocode environment. That means there's nothing to compile.

In lieu of distributing Robocode and asking you to set up and compile it, I've recorded a demo where I talk through my code and then show it in action: https://youtu.be/2Fiy0FqwNBs
