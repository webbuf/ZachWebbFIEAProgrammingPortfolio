I've chosen three projects that I think show my competency with C++, specifically in the areas of algorithm design, program structure, and working with data structures. These projects are a path planner, a simulation of a memory manager, and a complete game of minesweeper. I've also included a AI for the program Robocode made with C#. While it's a C++ piece, I still wanted to include it because it involved my implementation of a piece of architecture very relevant to games, a finite state machine.  More information on each project, including how to build it, can be found in each project's subdirectory.
